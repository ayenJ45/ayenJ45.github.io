			<h1>Coding</h1>
			<p>I was first interested at the age of 7 and now I know HTML, CSS and some basic JavaScript and Python. Last year, one of my WOW Wednesday presentations and this presentation right now is fully coded in HTML and CSS. I love coding because I want to make lots of websites and programs.</p>
